                    This section here will list out some of the common HTML Tags we use to create the "barebones" stucture of a website.
                    I am designing this page as a reference from my own notes. Just a few main components of the basics of HTML and CSS.
                </p>

                    <li>
                        List tag - like the tags used to create this list using <em>ul, ol, or li</em>  tags is a great way to list information in a more comprehensable
                        way. You can list out steps or notes like im doing now.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Heading tags - These tags are very important. They help shoe the user what the next chunk of content on the page is about.
                        the go from h1 to h6. 
                        <h1>Heading 1</h1><h2 class="notext">Heading 2</h2><h3>Heading 3</h3><h4 class="notext">Heading 4</h4><h5>Heading5</h5><h6>Heading 6</h6> 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Anchor tags - These tags provide <a href="https://youtu.be/ma67yOdMQfs" target="_blank" class="button">"surfability"</a> of your site. With the a tags you can link your sight to any sight you want.
                        It's common practice to link to a sight thats relevent to the page you are creating. Use href to set a specific URL or 
                        relative path to another page on your site.

                    How to add Images and Videos
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This section will focus on the different ways that we can add images or videos to our website. There are multiple ways to add a 
                    video or image to your page. First we will show the img tag in use. Next up will be the figure tag with the figcaption included.
                    Finally we will go over the video tag along with some of its attributes. Let's get started
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Steps to adding an image using img tag:
                </h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Add img tag. Remember this is a self closing tag. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Add the src attribute and add the URL of the image you would like to link. This can also be done using a relative path.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Next add the alt attribute. This technically does not need to be added but it helps with screen readers and the SEO of the page.
                        You can add a description of the picture.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Next close it out with /> 
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <p class="caption">
                    "The image above was used using the method listed above. I just pulled this image off of google for reference."
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Steps to adding an image using figure tag with figcaption:
                </h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        First you want to add your figure tag.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Next you're going to add your img tag and use the steps above. <br> Note: Other attributes you can add too img are width/height. 
                        Or you can later style these elements in CSS.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Now you can add your figcaption opening tag.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Go ahead and add a caption in and it will appear at the bottom left of the image you want to display.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Finally go ahead and close out both tags. Make sure you do them in order figcaption then figure. 
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <figure>
                    <img src="./cheatsheet.image.png" alt="snipping tool image stackoverflow" class="image">
                    <figcaption class="caption">
                        "This caption was added using fig caption. Also this time I used a relative path to link the image to the page with ./ 
                        and the path in the directory you're working in."
                    </figcaption>
                </figure>
                <h4>
                    Steps for adding a video using video tag:
                </h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        The first step you want to take is add your opening video tag.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Now you can add your src attribute along with the URL/relative path to the video you would like to display. <br>
                        Note: with video like image you can add the follwing attributes width/height or you can style them in CSS.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        After you add your URL add the controls attribute. This will the the browser to add default pause, play, or fullscreen
                        buttons to your video.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Close your opening tag and its common practice to add "Video Not Supported" just in case the browser doesn't load your
                        video this will be displayed.

            <h2>
                Common CSS Selectors
            </h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Type - this is basically just selecting all of the type of element. For example if you write a CSS ruleset for type h2, the 
                    following style would style all h2 elements.
                    <div class="example">
                    <br>h2 {<br> color: red;<br> }
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Class - This is probably the most common and customizable selector. You use the class attribute in your HTML file, and then you 
                    can select to style that class like so (.class). Make sure to put a period in front of the class you would like to style.
                    <div class="example">
                        <br>.class {<br>background-color: #14bb12;<br>}
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Universal - This slector should only be used when absolutely nessicary. The will still all the elements at once.
                    <div class="example">
                        <br>* {<br>box-sizing: border-box;<br>}
                    </div> 
                </li>
                <li>
                    id - With this selector it is important to style one element at a time. These are for more unique styles for elements.
                    This meaning that it can not be recycled like the class attribute and should be used when needed. Put the hash (#) in front
                    to select your id in CSS.
                    <div class="example">
                        <br>#id {<br>font-family: 'Zen Dots';<br>font-weight: bold;<br>}
                    </div>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <img src="./list.snippet.project.png" alt="Snippet of the code used" class="image">
            <p class="caption">
                "This snippet above is of the code that was used to style the examples in the list above."
            </p>
